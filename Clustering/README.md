# Clustering Algorithms Exploration

## Overview
This repository contains an exploration of different clustering algorithms in unsupervised machine learning. The project demonstrates the practical implementation and comparison of three popular clustering algorithms: **K-means**, **Agglomerative Clustering**, and **DBSCAN**. A synthetic dataset is used to evaluate the performance and behavior of these algorithms.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Dataset Generation and Visualization**: Creating and visualizing a synthetic dataset using the `make_moons` function.
2. **K-means Clustering**: Implementation of the K-means algorithm and visualization of its clustering results.
3. **Agglomerative Clustering**: Application of Agglomerative Clustering and its performance evaluation.
4. **DBSCAN**: Clustering using DBSCAN, focusing on its ability to detect noise and non-linearly shaped clusters.

All files related to this project are located in the **Clustering** folder.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to explore and compare the performance of different clustering algorithms. By the end of this project, you will gain:

- A solid understanding of the principles behind K-means, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN.
- Hands-on experience implementing these algorithms on a real dataset.
- The ability to analyze the strengths and limitations of each algorithm in different scenarios.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
To run the notebook and explore the clustering algorithms:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NMVRALI/MachinelearningProjects.git
```

2. Navigate to the **Clustering** folder:

```bash
cd MachinelearningProjects/Clustering
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Clustering_Algorithms_Exploration.ipynb`).

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to understand the theory and implementation of each clustering algorithm.

## Results
The project will produce visualizations of the clustering results, which will help you analyze how each algorithm performs on the synthetic dataset.

- **K-means Clustering**: Expected to perform well with spherical clusters.
- **Agglomerative Clustering**: Should work well with hierarchical clusters.
- **DBSCAN**: Effective for detecting clusters of arbitrary shapes and noise.

## Conclusion
By experimenting with these three clustering algorithms, this project provides insights into how each algorithm performs under different conditions. K-means is ideal for well-separated, spherical clusters, while Agglomerative Clustering works better for hierarchical data. DBSCAN excels in handling noise and clusters of arbitrary shapes.
