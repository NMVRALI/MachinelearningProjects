# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier on MNIST Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset in machine learning, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Objective
The goal is to classify the digits in the MNIST dataset by applying the KNN algorithm, a simple yet powerful supervised machine learning technique.

## Key Features
- **Dataset:** MNIST dataset, loaded using popular libraries.
- **Model:** Implementation of KNN algorithm for classification.
- **Evaluation:** Analysis of model accuracy and performance metrics.
- **Visualization:** Display of sample predictions.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook knn.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess it, train the KNN classifier, and evaluate its performance.

## Results
The notebook provides:
- Training and testing accuracy of the KNN model.
- A confusion matrix to visualize classification performance.
- Examples of correct and incorrect predictions.

## Customization
You can modify the following parameters to experiment with the KNN classifier:
- **`n_neighbors`**: Number of neighbors to consider in the KNN algorithm.
- **Distance Metric**: Change the distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) in the KNN model.
- **Data Split**: Adjust the train-test split ratio.
