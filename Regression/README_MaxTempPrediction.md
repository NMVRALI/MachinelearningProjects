# Max Temperature Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **Maximum Temperature (MaxTemp)** using various meteorological features, such as **Precipitation (Precip)**, **Mean Temperature (MeanTemp)**, **Snowfall**, and other related variables. By leveraging machine learning regression models, the goal is to build an accurate model for daily temperature predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains several weather-related variables, including:
- **Precipitation (Precip)**
- **Snowfall (Snowfall)**
- **MaxTemp** (the target variable)
- **Mean Temperature (MeanTemp)** and other relevant features.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Load and examine the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Drop irrelevant features and preprocess categorical variables.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Identify features relevant to predicting MaxTemp.
   - Visualize feature correlations with the target variable.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a **Linear Regression** model.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (RÂ²)**.

4. **Conclusions:**
   - Summarize the model's performance and suggest improvements.

## Files Included
- `MaxTemp Prediction.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
